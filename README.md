# Tetris_2048

ABSTRACTION

The Tetris 2048 Python Project is a game that blends Tetris' basic principles with 2048's tile-merging concept, resulting in a unique and entertaining puzzle experience. The goal was to create a game that promotes strategic thinking while retaining the fast-paced, addictive quality of the component games. The project used Python and related libraries to create the game, which is both functional and visually appealing.


DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

The project included mixing Tetris and 2048 to create a game in Python 3. Tetris was first created with its fundamental components, then additional parts from 2048 were added. The game consists of typical Tetris forms (tetrominoes) with numbers printed on them, such as 2048. The right panel shows the score and the next shape. It's important to remember that clearing as many horizontal lines of blocks as you can is the primary objective of Tetris.

The game features unique elements, such as an optimized GUI, a preview of the next tetromino, a pause button, a selection of different levels of difficulty. Additionally, the 'a' key can be used to rotate the tetrominos,
